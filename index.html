						<h2>Modelling Traffic in Hurricane Evacuations</h2>
						<p>Through a summer research position at the MIT Media Lab, I created a model for traffic due to hurricane evacuations. Over the course of the simulation, the program builds up a heat map to highlight congested areas so that interventions can be focused towards those areas. I'm especially interested in how evacuations would also impact those with less mobility or access to transportation.</p>

						<h2>Transformative Classroom Experiences</h2>
						<p>In a human-centered design course, we worked with special educators to re-design a classroom to enable individualized learning and normalize special needs. We proposed a type of stool to address multiple sensory needs and noise-cancelling curtains for a modular space. Most importantly, these tools are accessible to all students to help normalize special needs and promote agency for students to choose what works best for them.</p>

						<h2>Smart Energy Microgrids to enable Renewable Energy</h2>
						<p>Over the past summer, I worked on a research project contracted by the US Department of Energy about introducing artificial intelligence into the energy grid. Small-scale renewable energy inherently produces variable levels of power, so an accompanying battery can help supply a more consistent amount of electricity based on the needs of the local grid. I investigated how computational edge intelligence in smart batteries could complement renewable energy sources and stabilize energy use on the electric grid.</p>

						<h2>My Story</h2>
						<div class="index align-left">

							<!-- Text -->

								<!-- <header>
									<h3>Text</h3>
								</header> -->
								<div class="content">
									<p>My view of the world and goals for the future were shaped starting in elementary school. I went to the Haggerty School in Cambridge, MA, an inclusion-based public school where I had classes with people from around the world with a range of mental, physical, and academic abilities. I developed a great respect for all my friends and classmates and learned so much from their varied opinions, thoughts, and knowledge. Growing up, it seemed to be a simple truth that people came from a variety of backgrounds that provided unique strengths and contributed to a diverse, balanced community. And so it felt deeply unfair to realize that people like my classmates with different needs and backgrounds are excluded from systems that should benefit everyone.</p>

									<h3>I want to work in issues of justice, because the circumstances that someone is born into should not exclude them from basic rights and opportunities. </h3>

									<p>My interest in environmental justice, in particular, coincided with a couple of concurrent realizations. The house where I grew up is in a flood plain, and we experience flooding in storms with heavy rainfall. It’s gotten worse in recent years due to climate change, and our neighborhood has become increasingly at risk for very bad damage during big storms and hurricanes. But during city council hearings and neighborhood action groups, addressing these issues is never a high enough priority to prompt significant action or changes in policies.  </p>

									<p>This follows the same pattern of other environmental issues in Boston and other parts of the world. The people most at risk – both in my neighborhood and in the global community - are people without the types of resources needed to recover after these events. I’d like to continue working in the area of environmental and social issues through my career, using my electrical and computer engineering skills and design experience where they can help.</p>

									<h3>My vision is to apply my design and engineering background to address issues of environmental justice, by focusing on interdisciplinary, community-driven solutions.</h3>


									<p>Can computing help understand how complex systems affect people? I spent time at the MIT Media Lab working on modelling traffic during hurricane evacuations to help understand how all people, especially vulnerable populations, might be impacted by severe weather events. I’m intrigued by the potential for modeling and computing to provide insights to these systems, to help guide improvements and policy interventions. I think it is critical to include community voices through this entire process.</p>

									<p>How do you engage and empower communities with respect and humility? Through my project in community development in rural Mississippi, I’ve learned about the intricacies of navigating a context completely different from my own by listening and learning from stakeholders and local leaders. Our team works closely with respected community members so that this is truly a community-driven project. For example, we heard repeatedly that youth want more choice and creativity, so we redesigned our curriculum to include more options for projects with 3D printed speaker boxes, screen printing, web design, and simple instrument building. We use the framework of testing assumptions to ensure that the decisions we make are grounded in real needs and values of the entire community. This is the approach I want to use throughout all the work I will do.</p>

									<h3>I believe that listening and truly caring has the power to change systems and help people. I plan to spend the rest of my life doing so.</h3>

									<!-- <p>A written, cohesive story that ties together all my projects will go here. This is my GCSP reflection.</p>
									<p>Some thoughts:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Haggerty School and Inclusion (UOCD Special Education)</li>
										<li>Environmental Justice in Systems (GROW + Media Lab)</li>
										<li>Community-based development (ADE)</li>
