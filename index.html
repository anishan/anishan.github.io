						<h2>Shifting Rhythms: Mobile Education Space</h2>
						<p>I'm part of a team of college students and community partners in rural Mississippi, creating a mobile education space to teach technology, entrepreneurship, and arts to youth. We believe that by exercising creative expression, self-efficacy, and an entrepreneurial mindset, youth will develop the skills and confidence to create opportunities for themselves within and beyond their communities.</p>

						<h2>My Story</h2>

									<h3>Text</h3>
								</header> -->
								<div class="content">
									<p>My view of the world and goals for the future were shaped starting in elementary school. I went to the Haggerty School in Cambridge, MA, an inclusion-based public school where I had classes with people from around the world with a range of mental, physical, and academic abilities. In first grade, I had weekly play-dates with my classmate Michaela. We played on her backyard trampoline and ate sweet potato fries; her severe autism never interfered with our play. Growing up, it seemed to be a simple truth that people came from a variety of backgrounds that provided unique strengths and contributed to a diverse, balanced community. And so it felt deeply unfair to realize that people like my classmates with different needs and backgrounds are excluded from systems that should benefit everyone.</p>

									<h3>I want to work in issues of justice, because the circumstances that someone is born into should not exclude them from basic rights and opportunities. </h3>

									<p>My interest in environmental justice, in particular, coincided with a couple concurrent realizations. The house where I grew up is in a flood plain, and we experience flooding in storms with heavy rainfall. It’s gotten worse in recent years due to climate change, and our neighborhood has become increasingly at risk for very bad damage during big storms and hurricanes. But during city council hearings and neighborhood action groups, addressing these issues is never a high enough priority to prompt significant action or changes in policies.  </p>

									<p>This follows the same pattern of other environmental issues in Boston and other parts of the world. The people most at risk – both in my neighborhood and in the global community - are people without the types of resources needed to recover after these events. I’d like to continue working in the area of environmental and social issues through my career, using my electrical and computer engineering skills and design experience where they can help.</p>

									<h3>My vision is to apply my design and engineering background to address issues of environmental justice, by focusing on interdisciplinary, community-driven solutions.</h3>


									<p>Can computing help understand how complex systems effect people? I spent time at the MIT Media Lab working on modelling traffic during hurricane evacuations to help understand how all people, especially vulnerable populations, might be impacted by severe weather events. I’m intrigued by the potential for modeling and computing to provide insights to these systems, to help guide improvements and policy interventions. I think it is critical to include community voices through this entire process.</p>

									<p>How do you engage and empower communities with respect and humility? Through my project in community development in rural Mississippi, I’ve learned about the intricacies of navigating a context completely different from my own by listening and learning from stakeholders and local leaders. Our team works closely with respected community members so that this is truly a community-driven project. We practice human-centered design through respect and genuine curiosity to constantly improve our understanding of the needs and values of the entire community. This is the approach I want to use throughout all the work I will do.</p>

									<h3>I believe that listening and truly caring has the power to change systems and help people. I plan to spend the rest of my life doing so.</h3>

									<!-- <p>A written, cohesive story that ties together all my projects will go here. This is my GCSP reflection.</p>
									<p>Some thoughts:</p>
