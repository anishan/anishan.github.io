MIT Media Lab - Traffic during Hurricane Evacuations,"I created a model for traffic during evacuations due to hurricanes in Massachusetts. Evacuations can be difficult to plan for due to the limited data, and models can help guide policies. I used queueing theory to model the vehicles using techniques of agent-based modelling. The simulation is based off population data and environmental data about which areas will be effected during hurricanes. The following semester I extended this model to city traffic to predict the effect of new housing or commercial developments.",,https://github.com/anishan/hurricane-evacuation-model,AgentsScreenshot.JPG,"Processing, Java, Data Visualization",Independent Project under Ira Winder,Summer 2016,0
Smart Energy Microgrids to enable Renewable Energy,"Through a summer internship at Introspective Systems and a grant from the Department of Energy, I conducted research on smart energy microgrids to see if they can address the issues of variable renewable energy. In a system with a solar panel and house, a smart battery can help stabilize energy demand. I created the artificial intelligence in the battery using and actor-critic pair of neural networks that used adaptive dynamic programming to make real-time decisions. I also created the simulation framework that will be used by the company for the rest of this research project.",,,introspective.JPG,"Neural Networks, Adaptive Dynamic Programming, Renewable Energy Technology, Node.js",Independent Project,Summer 2017,0
Modeling Gentrification with Discrete Math,"For our discrete math final project, we modelled gentrification in cities using k-means clustering, bayesian statistics, and machine learning techniques. Using data from the census and the American Community Survey, we classified neighborhoods based on economic parameters. We then trained our model on previous years to understand the likelihood of neighborhoods transitioning between different ""gentrification states."" We created a visualization of this model with a web interface to display the results.",https://manickyoj.github.io/GentrificationModel/,https://github.com/ManickYoj/GentrificationModel,GentrificationMap.PNG,"Python, Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, Javascript, d3",Team of Three,2016,0
Transformative Classroom Experience for Special Education,"I spent the semester working with a team to learn about and co-design with special educators. We interviewed and observed teachers to understand their needs, then co-designed solutions with them. Our final project was re-designing a classroom to enable individualized learning and normalize special needs. We proposed a grid-system of noise-cancelling curtains, wobble stools that enable movement to aid in concentration, and a designated special education space so that everyone benefits from access to materials for special needs students. Since these resources would be accessible to all students, it normalizes the needs of students.",,,uocd.jpg,"Human-centered design, Interviewing, Collaboration, Co-design, Design Proposals, Illustrator",Team of Four,2017,0
Optimizing the Carbon Footprints of Diets,"As an independent study, I studied different mathematical models for modeling resource use in the context of agriculture and food systems. My final project examined diets around the world, and how they can be optimized (within tolerances) to decrease the carbon footprint. I used sensitivity analysis to identify which changes had the largest impact.",,,NRMoptimized_us.png,"MATLAB, Modeling",Independent Project,2016,1
IDIN - Zambian Charcoal Briquettes,"We worked with a business-woman in Zambia who makes charcoal briquettes from agricultural waste, which reduces deforestation. She was having an issue with her briquettes - they would fall apart while burning. We analyzed the material properties of samples of her charcoal in comparison to commercial charcoal, and used the tests to make recommendations for improving the briquettes. We also made our own charcoal out of local corn husks and stalks (pictured here).",,,charcoal.PNG,Materials Science,Team of Three,2016,0
Simulating the Apollo Guidance Computer,"To learn about historical computer architecture, I worked with a classmate to create a simulation of the Apollo Guidance Computer in Verilog. We created the processor and memory based the specifications of the actual computer, and encoded functionality to execute a subset of the instruction set. We were able to run some of the original source code on our simulation.",,https://github.com/anishan/apollo_simulator,AGCBlockDiagram.jpg,Verilog,Team of Two,2016,1
Draper Laboratory - Immersive Situational Awareness,"I worked with the human centered engineering group at Draper to design and develop an app for Google glass. The app dynamically displayed visual cues, and was responsive as the user turned their head. My work was part of the immersive situational awareness research project, which tested different methods of conveying information about surroundings. I used human-centered design techniques to design the visual interface, and used Android programming to develop the Google Glass application.",,,Draper-Map.JPG,"Android development, Wearable technology, Web development, Human centered design",Independent Project within Human Centered Engineering Department,Summer 2015,0
Refugee Data Visualization,"For our Data Visualization class, I worked with two people to create a visualization of refugees moving around the world over time. This was based off a dataset from the UN, and was drawn on a map using the GEOJson library in D3.",http://anishan.github.io/dataviz_final_project/,https://github.com/anishan/dataviz_final_project,Refugees-Screenshot.JPG,"JavaScript, D3, SQLite",Team of Three,2015,0
Lazer Maze,"You know those scenes in spy movies where a character breaks into an important building and nimbly navigates a maze of laser beam tripwires? For our course Principles of Engineering, a mechatronics course, my team created a laser maze experience where players attempt to navigate an obstacle course as quickly as possible without breaking the laser beams. Our project focused on integrating software, electrical, and mechanical systems. We created a web GUI for the game interface, which detected breaks in the moving laser beams through sensors connected to a raspberry pi.",http://poe.olin.edu/2015/lazermaze/,https://github.com/anishan/poe-2015,LazerMaze-Beams.jpg,"Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Sensors and signal processing, Circuit prototyping, Python, Flask, Agile development, Soldering, Gameplay design",Team of Five,2015,0
Bias in News Sources,"For my software design course, I created an algorithm to compare different news sources by analyzing the sentiment of articles. For a given event, the program finds the primary news articles about that event for different news companies. I ran the analyzer for the State of the Union Address (Jan 2015), the People's Climate March in New York (Sept 2015), and the Keystone Pipeline Veto (Feb 2015). Even with just these three events, you can see trends in how different news companies report on certain topics.",,https://github.com/anishan/news_analysis,NewsBias-ClimateMarch.png,"Python, Web scraping, Numpy library, Pattern library",Independent Project,2015,1
Aquaponics System,"I helped to start a new chapter of Net Impact by Design on campus, where we are promoting engineering build projects with a social or environmental impact. Our first project was building a small-scale aquaponics system to learn methods of growing food indoors. I helped lead the electrical subteam, and we worked on controlling the lights and water pump on a timer through a web application.",,,Aquaponics-Plants.jpg,"Raspberry Pi, Power control (basic), Leadership",Project Build Team,2015-2016,0
Sustainability Club,"I'm co-leading the sustainability club at Olin, where we have been working on campus-wide  initiatives. We have worked with facilities to make drying racks available in all the laundry rooms, which has lead to a noticeable decrease in dryer use and energy. We have also worked with the dining hall to introduce reusable travel cups as an alternative to paper cups, which has contributed to a 10-15% decrease in paper cup usage. I'm also part of the Sustainability Steering Committee, where I have worked with faculty and staff to create a Revolving Green Fund and evaluate sustainability at Olin.",,,grow.png,Leadership,Club,2014-present,0
Modeling Wolf Populations in Yellowstone,"In my Modeling and Simulation class, I modeled the effect of re-introducing wolves into the Yellowstone ecosystem through a conservation effort in 1995. I also modeling the subsequent changes in the elk and aspen species, as the wolves controlled the elk population, which allowed the aspen to recover. I also validated this model with data from the National Parks Service.",,,Wolves-TimeSeries.jpg,"MATLAB, Modeling",Independent Project,2014,1
This Website,"I created this website portfolio from scratch, in order to teach myself web development along the way. I deliberately chose not to use a bootstrapped template so that I would write and understand the purpose of each line of code. The portfolio is loaded automatically from a csv file containing my projects, so that I can quickly update my projects without editing the source HTML.
