MIT Media Lab - Hurricane Evacuation Model,"I created a model for traffic during evacuations due to hurricanes in Massachusetts. Evacuations can be difficult to plan for due to the limited data, so hopefully models can help guide policies. I used queueing theory to model the vehicles, in a type of agent-based model. The simulation is based off population data and environmental data about which areas will be effected during hurricanes.",,https://github.com/anishan/hurricane-evacuation-model,AgentsScreenshot.JPG,"Processing, Java, Data Visualization",Independent project under Ira Winder,Summer 2016
Modeling Gentrification with Discrete Math,"For our discrete math final project, we modelled gentrification in cities using k-means clustering, bayesian statistics, and machine learning techniques. Using data from the census and the American Community Survey, we classified neighborhoods based on economic parameters. We then trained our model on previous years to understand the likelihood of neighborhoods transitioning between different ""gentrification states."" We created a visualization of this model with a web interface to display the results.",https://manickyoj.github.io/GentrificationModel/,https://github.com/ManickYoj/GentrificationModel,,"Python, Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, Javascript, d3",Team of Three,2016
Transformative Classroom Experience,"I spent the semester working with a team to learn about and co-design with special educators. We interviewed an observed teachers to understand their needs, then co-designed solutions with them. Our final project was re-designing a classroom to enable individualized learning and normalize special needs. We proposed a grid-system of noise-cancelling curtains, wobble stools that enable movement to aid in concentration, and a designated special education space so that everyone benefits from access to materials for special needs students.",,,uocd.jpg,"Human-centered design, Interviewing, Collaboration, Co-design, Design Proposals, Illustrator",Team of Four,2017
Shoot for the Moon: Creating the Apollo Guidance Computer,"To learn about historical computer architecture, I worked with a classmate to create a simulation of the Apollo Guidance Computer in Verilog. We created the processor and memory based the specifications of the actual computer, and encoded functionality to execute a subset of the instruction set. We were able to run some of the original source code on our simulation.",,https://github.com/anishan/apollo_simulator,,Verilog,Team of Two,2016
Draper Laboratory - Software Engineering Intern,"I worked with the human centered engineering group at Draper to design and develop an app for Google glass, over the summer. The app dynamically displayed visual cues, and was responsive as the user turned their head. My work was part of the immersive situational awareness research project, which was testing different methods of conveying information about surroundings. Throughout the summer, I concurrently designed the app with human centered design techniques and feedback from the rest of my team, and did the software development for a web-app and google glass app. I had not done Android programming prior to this, so I also learned some Android development along the way.",,,Draper-Map.JPG,"Android development, Wearable technology, Web development, Human centered design",Independent Project within Human Centered Engineering Department,Summer 2015
Refugee Data Visualization,"For our Data Visualization class, I worked with two people to create a visualization of refugees moving around the world over time. This was based off a dataset from the UN, and was drawn on a map using the GEOJson library in D3.",http://anishan.github.io/dataviz_final_project/,https://github.com/anishan/dataviz_final_project,Refugees-Screenshot.JPG,"JavaScript, D3, SQLite",Team of Three,2015
Lazer Maze,"You know those scenes in spy movies where a character breaks into an important building and nimbly navigates a maze of laser beam tripwires? For our course Principles of Engineering, a mechatronics course, my team created a laser maze experience where players attempt to navigate an obstacle course as quickly as possible without breaking the laser beams. Our project focused on integrating software, electrical, and mechanical systems. We created a web GUI for the game interface, which detected breaks in the moving laser beams through sensors connected to a raspberry pi.",http://poe.olin.edu/2015/lazermaze/,https://github.com/anishan/poe-2015,LazerMaze-SystemDiagram.png,"Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Sensors and signal processing, Circuit prototyping, Python, Flask, Agile development, Soldering, Gameplay design",Team of Five,2015
Natural Resource Modeling,"As an independent study, I'm studying different mathematical models for modeling resource use, especially in the context of agriculture and food systems. After I learn more about existing models, I will be researching a system and constraints, in order to design and implement a mathematical model.",,,,"MATLAB, Modeling",Independent Project,2016
News Article Sentiment Analyzer,"For my software design course, I created an algorithm to compare different news sources by analyzing the sentiment of articles. I thought that by looking at trends in reporting, it would be possible to see bias in the news. For a given event, the program finds the primary news articles about that event for different news companies. The first part of the program involves web scraping (with the pattern.web Google API) to find the most relevant article from each news source. Then, after a bit of HTML scraping, the program uses the pattern.en sentiment analyzer to determine  how positive/negative and how subjective/objective the article is. I graphed the results with the numpy package.

You can see some of the final graphs in the images. I ran the analyzer for the State of the Union Address (Jan 2015), the People's Climate March in New York (Sept 2015), and the Keystone Pipeline Veto (Feb 2015). Even with just these three events, you can see a trend in how different news companies report on certain topics.",,https://github.com/anishan/news_analysis,NewsBias-ClimateMarch.png,"Python, Web scraping, Numpy library, Pattern library",Independent Project,2015
Aquaponics System,"I helped to start a new chapter of Net Impact by Design on campus, where we are promoting engineering build projects with a social or environmental impact. Our first project was building a small-scale aquaponics system to learn methods of growing food inside. I helped lead the electrical subteam, and we worked on controlling the lights and water pump on a timer through a web application.",,,Aquaponics-Plants.jpg,"Raspberry Pi, Power control (basic), Leadership",Project Build Team,2015-2016
Sustainability Club (GROW),"I'm co-leading the sustainability club at Olin, where we have been working on campus-wide  initiatives. We have worked with facilities to make drying racks available in all the laundry rooms, which has lead to a noticeable decrease in dryer use and energy. We have also worked with the dining hall to introduce reusable travel cups as an alternative to paper cups, which has contributed to a 10-15% decrease in paper cup usage.",,,GROW-cups.jpg,Leadership,Club,2014-present
Modeling Wolf Populations in Yellowstone,"In my Modeling and Simulation class, I modeled the effect of re-introducing wolves into the Yellowstone ecosystem through a conservation effort in 1995. I also modeling the subsequent changes in the elk and aspen species, as the wolves controlled the elk population, which allowed the aspen to recover. I also validated this model with data from the National Parks Service.",,,Wolves-TimeSeries.jpg,"MATLAB, Modeling",Independent Project,2014
This Website,"I created this website portfolio from scratch, in order to teach myself web development along the way. I deliberately chose not to use a bootstrapped template so that I would write and understand the purpose of each line of code. The portfolio is loaded automatically from a csv file containing my projects, so that I can quickly update my projects without editing the source HTML.
