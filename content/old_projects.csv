Recipe Finder Program,"Working with a team of three, we created web-app to search for recipes based on the ingredients available to the user. As college students, we often get frustrated by recipes that call for ingredients that we might not have easily available.

We interfaced with the web GUI with Flask.",http://aconsilvio.github.io/recipe_program/,https://github.com/aconsilvio/recipe_program,Recipes-Screenshot.jpg,"Python, MongoDB, Flask, Server Management (basic)",Team of Three,2015
